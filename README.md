# Social media dashboard with theme switcher solution

I created this dashboard as a practice project to further develop my CSS Grid, Flexbox and JavaScript skills. This code is the solution to one of the challenges developed by frontendmentor.io. They provided the raw materials, such as the text and the images. I did all of the codework.
